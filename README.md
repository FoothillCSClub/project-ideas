## Simple Games for Programming Practice

Need a quick programming project? Try making a simple classic game!

Programming simple games can be very good to practice programming, or 
when learning a new programming language. Many simple games can be 
programmed fully inside a interactive terminal or with simple 
graphics.

Since there are so many different kinds of games out there in the 
world, you can more easily choose one that matches your experience 
level and the amount of time you have availiable. You can add your own 
embelishments, or customize them with your own creativity.

For Multi-Player games, you can design it so that players take
turns inputting their moves, or you can program the computer to be 
the opponent for an extra challenge.
