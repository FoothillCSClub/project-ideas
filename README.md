## Simple Games for Programming Practice

Need a quick programming project? Try making a simple classic game!

Programming simple games can be very good to practice programming, or 
when learning a new programming language. Many simple games can be 
programmed fully inside a interactive terminal or with simple 
graphics.

Since there are so many different kinds of games out there in the 
world, you can more easily choose one that matches your experience 
level and the amount of time you have availiable. You can add your own 
embelishments, or customize them with your own creativity.

For Multi-Player games, you can design it so that players take
turns inputting their moves, or you can program the computer to be 
the opponent for an extra challenge.

### Single Player Games

* interactive text-based game, e.g. 
[ADVENT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure)
* snake
* simon says
* sliding puzzle
* 2048
* asteroids
* space invaders
* flappy bird
* minesweeper
* sudoku
* crossword
* breakout

### Multi-Player Games

* pong
* tick tac toe
* mancala
* checkers
* connect four
* blackjack
* poker
* yahtzee

## Miscellaneous List of Ideas  

**Chat Bot** - Write a terminal program that chats with the user.
A simple version would respond only to specific words or phrases, and
give general responses. An intermediate version could analyze 
the syntactic structure of the user's input and respond accordingly.
An advanced version could use techniques from machine learning to 
formulate responses. 

**Astronomy Calendar** - Make a web page where you can input
a location, and the site will display upcoming stronomical 
events that will be visible from that location (e.g. eclipses,
meteor showers). Additionally, it could display a picture to 
to show where in the sky that event can be seen.

## Cool things to try

* Discord bots are always fun! Ask the mods if you need ideas.
* Try some web scraping (learn the basics if you need to)
* Draw some graphics or make GIFs in python with [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
